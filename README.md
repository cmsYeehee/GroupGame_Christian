13 Planets

Inital Brainstorm
Premise of the game. 3-D exploration/mission game You are a hunted fugitive trying to increase your global status by conquering 13 missions. The missions are divided into different types, and there are different probabilities of which mission is generated. You start to wish for a starship and base starter equipment. In the beginning, a randomly generated bounty hunter will be assigned to follow you and act as a timer/quasi-obstacle for you to complete your mission. The mission types are as follows and an AI will generate the mission 

# 13 Planets

## Problem Definition and User Research

### Target Audience
- Sci-fi and space exploration enthusiasts
- Solo players looking for story-driven but unscripted experiences
- Players who enjoy sandbox-style progression and emergent gameplay
- Gamers who value replayability and procedurally generated content

### Why It's Engaging/Useful
- **Replayability**: Procedurally generated planets, loot, and mission types ensure no two playthroughs are the same
- **Emergent Gameplay**: AI-driven mission generation creates unique scenarios each time
- **Dynamic Challenge**: The bounty hunter mechanic creates a constant pressure that evolves with the player
- **Progression Freedom**: Players can tackle missions in different ways based on their preferred playstyle
- **Scalable Content**: Modular structure allows for continuous expansion of planets, missions, and upgrades

## Conceptualization and Design

### Main Features
1. **Procedural Universe**: 13 uniquely generated Missions with varying climates, gravity, and resources
2. **Mission Variety**: Four main mission types (Planets, Dogfights, Stations, Wreckage) with different probabilities
3. **Equipment Progression**: Customizable weapons, ships, and environmental protection suits
4. **Resource Management**: Limited inventory forcing strategic decisions
5. **Crafting System**: AI-generated recipes for weapons, ship upgrades, and gear
6. **Dynamic Antagonist**: AI-assigned bounty hunter that pursues the player throughout the game
7. **Boss Encounters**: Specialized challenges at the 7th and 13th levels

### User Flow/Game Progression
1. **Game Start**: Player begins with a starter base, starship, and default weapon
2. **Mission Selection**: An AI generates a mission from one of four categories
3. **Equipment Preparation**: Player selects loadout based on mission parameters and planet conditions
4. **Mission Execution**: Player completes objectives while managing time pressure from bounty hunter
5. **Resource Collection**: Gathering materials during missions for crafting
6. **Upgrades**: Using collected resources to improve ship, weapons, and protection suits
7. **Progression Loop**: After each mission, player warps to new location for next procedurally generated mission
8. **Mid-game Boss**: Confrontation with pursuing bounty hunter at Level 7
9. **Final Challenge**: Epic battle against an AI-controlled warship at Level 13
10. **New Game+**: Ability to start fresh with different starter packs

### Sketches and Design Details

#### Planet Generation Parameters
- **Climate Types**: Desert, Bog, Tundra, Forest, Ocean
- **Weather Conditions**: Rain, Snow, Radioactive Storms
- **Materials**: Randomly selected 3 of 9 possible resources (Copper, Iron, Ruby, Emerald, Silver, Gold, Rusted Tech, Steel, Diamond)
- **Gravity**: Randomized from 0.5 kg/m² to 80 kg/m² (affects movement and gameplay)

#### Mission Types Breakdown
- **Planets (65% chance)**
  - Raid: Infiltrate and loot random outposts
  - Explore: Reach specific locations for key items
  - Gather: Collect materials for crafting
  - Escape: Help captives escape from guarded facilities
  - Hunt: Track and capture/eliminate targets
- **Dogfights (10% chance)**
  - Space combat against enemy fighters or capital ships
- **Stations (20% chance)**
  - AI-generated maze challenges
  - Intel gathering, resource collection, or rescue missions
- **Wreckage (5% chance)**
  - Exploration of abandoned ships or outposts
  - Includes maze challenges in zero-gravity environments

#### Equipment System
- **Weapons**: 5 types (Spreadshot, Laser, Rapid Fire, Sniper, Blaster)
- **Ship Weapons**: Blasters, Ion Cannon, Slow Turret, Plasma Laser
- **Protection Suits**: Specialized for different hazards (Cold, Toxic, Heat)
- **Inventory**: 7 slots for player, 25 slots for ship (upgradable)

## Behaviors

### Key Engagement Mechanisms
1. **Procedural Generation**: Ensures fresh content and high replayability
   - AI-driven mission parameters
   - Randomized planet conditions and resources
   - Variable enemy patterns

2. **Time Pressure**: The bounty hunter mechanic creates urgency
   - Forces players to balance thoroughness with speed
   - Creates dynamic "chase" scenarios
   - Adapts to player strategies over time

3. **Strategic Resource Management**:
   - Limited inventory slots require prioritization
   - Environmental hazards demand appropriate gear
   - Crafting system encourages exploration for materials

4. **Adaptive Difficulty**:
   - Boss encounters respond to player's preferred tactics
   - Bounty hunter becomes more challenging as player progresses
   - Environmental conditions create natural difficulty variables

5. **Surprise Elements**:
   - Mid-mission interruptions from the bounty hunter
   - Random events during exploration
   - Unexpected resource discoveries or enemy encounters
